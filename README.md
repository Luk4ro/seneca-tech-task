# Created with create-react-app

### Assumptions and limitations

- I havent implemented checking for the window resize event so the page needs to be refreshed once resized to get the correct visuals.
- Colour selection doesn't closely match designs
- 

### Extentions complete

- The order of the questions & answer positions should be randomised

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
